# Classification Project: TF-IDF Linear SVM and Logistic Regression implementation

**Author:** Kevin Pham and pals
**Course:** CSC 4850 Machine Learning  

## Overview

This project builds a system that learns from labeled emails to tell apart spam from real ones. Instead of just one method, it tests SVM and Logistic Regression with TF-IDF. Rather than guessing which works better, performance comes down to actual results measured by F1 score. Once picked, the top model gets moved into live use where it starts filtering messages right away.


## HOW TO RUN
1. Go to the github link and copy repository to your device

2. Navigate to spam_email directory and open SpamDetection.py
3. Run the code
